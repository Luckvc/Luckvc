- I’m Lucas, I am currently a systems analysis and development undergrad at the brazilian university FIAP. In parallel I also own and run a young business in the food industry that I hope to grow and improve using my coding experience.
- I haven't decided my focus on the matter of programing languages yet. So, for now, I am trying to have different experiences.
